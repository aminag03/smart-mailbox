1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aminag03/smart-mailbox.git
cd smart-mailbox
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Upload the code to NodeMCU ESP8266 via Arduino IDE**

Install the ESP8266 board package

Install the Firebase ESP Client library

Enter your Wi-Fi and Firebase credentials

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Enter your Firebase credentials in index.html**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the web application**


## Features

**Microcontroller**: NodeMCU ESP8266

**Sensor**: TCRT5000 IR sensor

**Cloud database**: Firebase Realtime Database

**Frontend**: Web application for mailbox status display (HTML and CSS)

**Programming languages**: C++ (Arduino), JavaScript (for the web application)

## Project Goal

Smart Mailbox enhances convenience and efficiency in mail reception, allowing users to know at any moment whether they have received mail without the need for physical mailbox checks. Additionally, the system facilitates communication between users and postal workers by providing a visual confirmation of successful delivery.
